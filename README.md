- 👋 Hi, I’m Troy
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things but there's not enough time in the day. Do find time to run though :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - re-learning actually. Did web dev back in college but veered off that path. Way off. Looking to get back on it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on LAMP stuff. I think... maybe... not sure really. 
- 📫 How to reach me mulligan87@[gee]mail.com
